The NGT directed all state governments in Punjab, Haryana, UP, and Rajasthan to ensure zero stubble burning. States must provide subsidized machinery (Super SMS, Happy Seeder, Rotavator) and establish Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) at block level. Farmers transitioning to zero-burn practices are eligible for ₹1,500/acre incentive under the CRM scheme.
