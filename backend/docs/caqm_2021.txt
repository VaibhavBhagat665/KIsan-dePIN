Under Section 12 of the CAQM Act 2021, burning of crop residue in the NCR and adjoining areas is strictly prohibited. Farmers found burning stubble face penalties: ₹2,500 for plots < 2 acres, ₹5,000 for 2-5 acres, and ₹15,000 for plots > 5 acres. The Commission recommends in-situ management through Happy Seeder, bio-decomposer, and mulching techniques.
